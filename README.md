# ♻ Waste Management Database Design



A smart and scalable MySQL-based database designed to streamline urban waste handling, track smart bins, ensure environmental compliance, and manage recycling — all under one system.  



---



## 📌 What’s This Project About?



This project models a *complete waste management ecosystem* through a relational database. From bin distribution and waste collection to disposal, penalties, and incentives — every workflow is mapped and managed.



Designed for *real-world city-level operations*, it ensures proper tracking, accountability, and optimization.



---



## 🧠 What Makes It Special?



✨ *19 Tables* — covering all core operations  

🔐 *Role-Based Control* — Admins manage zones, trucks, and regulations  

🧹 *Smart Bin Monitoring* — Fill levels, types, carbon saved  

🚛 *Zone-wise Truck Assignment* — Efficient collection routing  

⚖ *Compliance System* — Penalties and rewards based on actions  

📜 *BCNF Normalized* — Clean, scalable, and maintainable  

🗃 *Sample Data Included* — For easy testing and demonstration

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Inside



- *ER Diagram* – Complete conceptual model  

- *Relational Schema* – Final structures with all constraints  

- *Sample Dataset* – Realistic entries for each table  

- *Logical Relationships* – Carefully designed foreign keys and mappings  

- *Documentation* – Clear descriptions of each component

## 🏁 Final Words



This project is built not just as an academic exercise, but as a *blueprint for real-world smart waste management systems* — efficient, compliant, and data-driven.



Let the data clean up the city! 🧹📊🌍
